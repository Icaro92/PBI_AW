## Objectives

This dashboard's objective is to provide a clear Sales Overview of Adventure Works. Specifically, the dashboard will accurately represent the Sales Goals as well as a detailed view of top customers and most selling products by category and location.

I've created a mock e-mail from Lucas, our Sales Manager with the requirements for his team. Based on those requirements, I've defined user stories to ensure that acceptance criteria were maintained throughout the project, wrote SQL queries, and organized the data in a Power BI dashboard for precise visualization. 

You can access the dashboard in the link below

## Data Source

For this project I used Microsoft's [Adventure Works sample databases](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver15&tabs=ssms) which provide realistic data sets for practicing SQL Server features, tools and techniques. It covers various business scenarios, including sales (used in this example), CRM, Manufacturing and more.

## Business Request & User Stories

  **Business Request**
  
  Lucas - Sales Manager:
  
    Hi Icaro!
    I hope youâ€™re doing well.
    
    We need to improve our internet sales reports and want to move from static reports to visual dashboards.
    Essentially, we want it to focus on how much we have sold of which products, to which clients, and how it has developed over time.
    Seeing as each salesperson works on different products and customers, it would be beneficial to be able to filter them also. 
    We measure our numbers against budget so I added that in a spreadsheet so we can compare our values against performance. 
    The budget is for 2022 and we usually look 2 years back in time when we analyze sales.
    Let me know if you need anything else!
    
    Best Regards,
    Lucas

## SQL Data Cleaning and Transformation

To create the necessary data model for correcly responding to the Business Request from Sales, the following tables were extracted using SQL.
Also, one table "Sales Budget" was provided in Excel format and was properly connected in the data model in a later step of the process.
